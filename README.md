Yun-ThingML: Use ThingML to fully exploit the capabilities of your Arduino Yun!
===========

This repository contains a set of ThingML libraries and examples to program applications using the Arduino Yun.

The Arduino Yun is an interesting platform because it is inexpessive, widely available, it contains 2 different processors and has good connectivity (Ethernet, Wifi). 
The two processors are:
* An 8 bit microcontroller ATmega32u4 (16MHz, 32k flash, 2.5k RAM, 1k EEPROM, 2 serial ports)
* 



When developing an application with the Arduino Yun it is possible to have parts of the application runnning on the microcontroller
